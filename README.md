# sML---Insurance-Simple-Linear-Regression

From the Insurance dataset, the SLR model will be used to determine how a persons Age affects their Insurance Costs. This same investigation is repeated in regards to a person's BMI and their Insurance Costs.

## Description

As the dataset has already been pre-processed, and the relevant columns needed for the analyses where stored in X and Y variables, Age and Insurance Cost, respectively. 

An scatter plot of the Age vs. Insurance Cost were plotted.

The Linear Regression model from Sklearn was then used to fit a model to the data so that predictions could be made.

Another scatter plot was plotted with a line-of-best fit was generated.

Some example predictions where then ran to determine how much a person of a certain age would pay on average for their insurance based on the model.

The same tasks where repeated for a person's BMI.
